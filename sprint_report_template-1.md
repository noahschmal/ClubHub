We did a lot of research to decide between the use of JavaScript and C# and finaly decided to use JavaScript with Node and TypeScript. This was done because we believed that this would give us a good amount of online resources as well as useability and flexibility going forward. This was especially important for our team as we had little to no experience with web development. 
In the back end and the database we ran into serveral issues. First in the backend we decided to use a tutorial to help shape a health long term backend the problem that we ran into though was that this specific tutorial was rather old. This meant that one of the libraries in use had changed and had left some of the code unusable. This had too be fixed and would not have been as dificult if it were not for it being the 
## Unfinished Work
We did not have any unfinished work because we decided to focus mainly on creating a solid foundation on which we will create the rest of the project. Specifically we decided to spend a lot of time looking at different language and layouts for out project as well as creating a flexible base. Therefore our actual programing was not quite as feature rich but should put us into a good position going forward.
